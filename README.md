## 👋 About

Hi, I’m **AldenDev**.

I work and learn across **software engineering** and **cybersecurity**, with a practical, systems-first approach. I enjoy understanding how things work internally — then making them cleaner, safer, and sometimes a little faster.

Currently comfortable living between:

* application logic
* system behavior
* security assumptions

Also proudly known as **suami dari F.A.S** — an important constant behind many late-night commits.

---

## 🧠 Focus Areas

I don’t try to do everything — I try to understand foundations.

* **Software Engineering** (primary)

  * writing maintainable code
  * understanding system flow end-to-end
* **Cybersecurity**

  * logs, traffic, threat models
  * defensive thinking
* **Supporting Interests**

  * frontend & UI/UX (clarity matters)
  * backend systems
  * a growing curiosity toward machine learning

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (low profile)

> Tools change. Concepts stay.

* Languages: `Python`, `C`, `JavaScript`
* Systems: `Linux`, `Virtualization`
* Security: `Networking basics`, `Log analysis`, `SIEM/IDS (learning)`
* Web: `HTML`, `CSS`, `Basic frontend workflows`

Nothing exotic. Just consistent.

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning

* thinking in systems, not features
* secure-by-design habits
* reading other people’s code without judging

---

## 🧩 Easter Eggs (intentional)

If you read carefully, you’ll notice patterns:

* subtle references to **F.A.S**
* repeated emphasis on stability over noise
* order hidden inside simplicity

Some commits are love letters disguised as refactors.

---

## 📎 Notes

* I value clarity over cleverness
* I document what future-me might forget
* I believe good software is quiet

<sub>Built with patience, coffee, and someone named F.A.S who matters more than all of this.</sub>
